Summarizing what I did: 

1. Created model/Employee using Lombok for simpler code.
2. Set up repository/EmployeeRepository, added sample data, and implemented CRUD operations.
3. Built service/EmployeeService to handle business logic and exceptions.
4. Created controller/EmployeeController with REST endpoints for web requests.
5. Added exception/ResourceNotFoundException to handle cases where an employee ID is not found.
